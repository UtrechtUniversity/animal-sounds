## [raven_to_wav](./raven_to_wav)
Raven to wav is used to filter annotated parts from the original `.wav` files based on annotations in table format (e.g. `.txt` or `.csv`).

## [Condensation](./condensation)
In condensation we use an energy change based method to filter out low energy parts from the original dataset to make manual annotation/labeling more efficient.

## [Synthetic data](./synthetic_data)
In Synthetic data we embed Chimpanze vocalizations in jungle sounds that are labeled as background to create more and more diverse data.

## [Chunk wav](./chunk_wav)
Chunk_wav component splits wav files into smaller chunks, as part of the preparation process for deep learning models.
